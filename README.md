Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?
- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
- What is the mission statement?

Many stay home moms report feeling 'stir crazy' and their social needs are not met. Enter AtoZ experiences (Think AirBNB experiences...but for stay at home moms) . People can host an experience, and earn money leading people on activities they love. It’s an opportunity for anyone to share their hobbies, skills, or expertise. The basic premise is to emulate Airbnb experiences, but instead of targeting tourists traveling to a new area, one targets stay-at-home moms.
Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
 
1. An on-boarding process for a new general user (user that will consume the service)2. On-boarding process for user who wants to generate content (i.e. organize experiences for other local stay-at-home moms)
3. profile page for users.
4. Ability to easily create / setup an experience
5. Ability to easily edit / delete an experience
6. Ability to easily search / find experience through title, dates, location, and price filters
7. Home page to see available experiences for general user

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
Allow user to set an availability schedule for each experience, whether that's daily, weekly, or monthly.

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
Airbnb, meetup, …..

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
